As a MORE GENERAL SOLUTION (BUT ASCII ONLY!), to INCLUDE ANY OTHER SEPARATORS BETWEEN WORDS (LIKE COMMAS AND SEMICOLONS), I SUGGEST:
STRING s = "I WANT to WALK my DOG, CAT, AND TARANTULA; MAYBE EVEN my TORTOISE.";
STRING[] WORDS = S.SPLIT("\\W+");
THE REGEX MEANS THAT THE DELIMITERS WILL be ANYTHING THAT is NOT a WORD [\W], in GROUPS of at LEAST ONE [+]. BECAUSE [+] is GREEDY, it WILL TAKE FOR INSTANCE ';' AND ' ' TOGETHER as ONE DELIMITER.
