"It's been 30 days, maybe 34"
"Since I left my house, tossed and grown out"
"The fires burn below"
"Pistons creak and groan"
"Under my feet the tension grows"
"Built up like the leaves around my door"
"They can say it better than I can"
"After months of neglect"
"I can start over again if I would just let it"
